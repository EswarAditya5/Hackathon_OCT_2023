**House Grade Prediction**
**Find The Best House:** The 1234ABC Realtors Limited is in great losses due to the automation in the industry and the new innovations and players in the real estate market. So they have hired a Data Science Team to give them a business solution so as to help regain their place in the market. In order to do that, the group thought of a compiled way of grading the houses in order from A to E with respect to different aspects in mind. This would help them to rate the houses as well as different areas as well. So gear up and help the realtors get back their place in the market.

Objective of the problem: The objective of the problem is to predict values “Grade” attribute from the given features of the Test data. Please view the sample submission file to understand how the submission file is to be written. Please upload the submission file to get a score.

-> The predictions are to be written to a CSV file along with ID which is the unique identifier for each tuple.
-> Please upload the submission file to get a score.
-> Please note that the training data is only for creating your data model and all predictions are to be made as per serial numbers on the test file.

Description of files: -

-> Training File: All features including the target would be present in this file. The machine learning model would trained using this file. This file is to be used for training and validation.
-> Test File: This file contains all features, but the target variable. Prediction is to be made for all tuples in the test
file. The predicted values are to be written to a CSV file along with the ID and uploaded.
-> Sample Submission: Sample submission is an example of how the actual submission file should be like

Description of the data attributes is as below:

• Area(total): Total area of the plot
• Trooms: Total Number of rooms in the house
• Nbedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house
• Nbwashrooms: Number of washrooms attached with bedroom
